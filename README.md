# VBA-Stock-Analysis
VBA Script for Stock Analysis project

This script will analyze a large excel file with multiple tabs of data relating to different stock values over time.  The program should:

1) Loop through all the data in each worksheet. 
2) Insert a summary table with auto formatting on each worksheet that shows:  
   a. Each ticker symbol. 
   
   b. The yearly change in per share value, with cell conditional formatting as green for an increase, red for a decrease. 
   
   c. The percent change in value of each stock. 
   
   d. The total volume of each stock during the period. 
   
3) The script will also account for values of zero or infinite as appropriate
